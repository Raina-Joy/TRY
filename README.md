# GREEN EARTH
 GREEN EARTH is a plastic waste management system which aims to clear plastic waste from industrial
& domestic areas. Already there is a system under the government to collect domestic plastic waste by
paying money to them. But some people are not willing to accept the system due to the loss of money,
they are finding other ways such as burning, throwing & landfills as plastic disposal methods. So here I’m
planning to implement a plastic collection system which helps the users to clear the plastic waste from
their habitat with zero cost & by that they can purchase anything with offers from different business
platforms. A user can register in the platform, then within 3 days they are provided with the carboard bin
to store the plastic waste. If the bin is filled then the user can raise a pickup on a scheduled date. After the
successful pickup of the bin the users will get a reward as purchase coupon based on their interest. The
implementing system leads a better plastic waste clearance along with sales promotion in various business
fields.
